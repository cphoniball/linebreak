##Linebreak.js

A small jQuery plugin that wraps your text in spans. This allows styling not achievable via CSS alone.

###Bugs
 - There are situations in which styling applied via the line wrap class causes words to shift lines - need to come up with a solution for this. Perhaps apply the styling to all of the text before taking the offset?
